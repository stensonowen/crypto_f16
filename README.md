# crypto_f16
Practice implementations of crypto concepts to accompany class

Don't actually use this. You shouldn't write your own crypto, and you definitely shouldn't use some random github repo.

Rust is a pretty good choice for this. There will be definite slowdown in accessing arrays because of the bounds checking, but that is somewhat offset by not needing to debug segfaults. Overall, this should be pretty fast but without some of the unpleasantries of writing C++.
